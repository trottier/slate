# Introduction

`hackerpet` is an open source library for programmatically controlling a CleverPet Hub and reporting the data it produces. It takes advantage of the fact that most CleverPet Hubs use a Particle Photon which can be easily replaced with your own.  This library enables your Photon to give you full control over the Hub's touchpads, sounds, and food reward presentation.

If you've not done so already, please visit [hackerpet.com](https://hackerpet.com)

## Getting started

Along with a port of CleverPet's [complete original training curriculum](http://hackerpet.com/cleverpet-curriculum/), hackerpet exists as a [library on the Particle platform.](https://build.particle.io/libs/hackerpet/). 

```cpp
#include <hackerpet.h>
```

### Library 

All your examples must explicitly include the hackerpet library ... 

```cpp
HubInterface hub;
```

### HubInterface declaration

... and subsequently declare the variable that will be used to access your Hub's functionality.

```cpp
void setup() {
  
  Serial1.begin(38400);  // needed for device layer (hub) communication
  hub.Initialize();

  // Other setup commands go here
}
```

### setup() 


Within the <code>setup</code> function make sure to set up serial communication with the rest of the Hub and then initialize it.

```cpp
void loop() {
  
  hub.run(20); // do 20 ms of communication with the rest of the Hub 
  //MyOwnFunction(); 

}
```

### loop() function

Usually, you'll have a function that gets called repeatedly within loop() that will control the behavior of your Hub (presenting lights, distributing foodtreats, etc.).

# Yield macro "magic"

 The HackerPet library provides a set of macros that make programming the Hub much faster, more concise, and more easily understood. These macros let you "yield" from the function, temporarily exiting and re-entering at the same position.  Essentially, these macros grab the function's line number and then jump back to this line when the function is re-entered. This lets the funtion momentarily surrender the Photon to the HackerPet library and give it an opportunity to tell the rest of the Hub to turn on its lights, play sounds, dispense foodtreats, etc.

There are a few things to consider when using yield macros:

* They are ideal for moments when your code would block. E.g., during delays or when waiting for input. Yielding can also be helpful when you want to give the HubInterface a moment to send out instructions, as it can only handle so many at once.
* Functions in which you’d like to use yield(…) must begin with a yield_begin() and a yield_finish(). This is demonstrated in the examples.
* No recursion allowed.
* All local variables must be static. This means that they won’t get re-initialized and receive a new value the next time the function is entered, so be sure to explicitly initialize them to the value you want in a separate statement. To keep things clean, any variable declarations that start with `static` should not be initialized.
* Whenever the function “yields” it returns a value. This can be helpful for telling you whether the function is actually over, or if it’s still working.

## Macros

```cpp
// EXAMPLE USAGE
bool MyFunction() 
{
  yield_begin();

  yield_wait_ms(500, false);

  yield_finish();
  return true;
}
```

### yield_begin()

Place this at start of any function that uses yield statement

### yield_finish()

Place at end of any function that uses yield statement

```cpp
//EXAMPLE USAGE
unsigned long start_ms = millis();
while (millis() - start_ms < 1000) // Pause for 1000 milliseconds
{
  yield(false); // Yield program flow (e.g. to HackerPet library)
}
```

### yield(*ret*)

Yield execution of your yield enabled function while returning `ret`. Next time your yield enabled function is called, execution will continue the last yield point.

```cpp
// EXAMPLE USAGE
unsigned long start_wait = Time.now();
yield_wait_for(Time.now() - start_wait > 10, false) // wait for 10 seconds
```

### yield_wait_for(*condition*, *ret*)

Wait for a condition while yielding whenever the condition is not true. Passes the `ret` parameter whenever yielding.

```cpp
// EXAMPLE USAGE
yield_sleep(50, false); // wait for 50 us 
```

### yield_sleep(*wait_time_in_microseconds*, *ret*)

Wait for the specified number of microseconds, yielding while waiting. Uses particle micros() function, which overflows when it reaches 2^32 (i.e., every ~71.6 minutes)

```cpp
// EXAMPLE USAGE
yield_sleep_ms(300, false); // wait for 300 ms
```

### yield_sleep_ms(*wait_time_in_milliseconds*, *ret*)

Wait for the specified number of milliseconds, yielding while waiting. Uses millis() function, which overflows and returns to zero every ~49 days

```cpp
// EXAMPLE USAGE 
 yield_if(Time.now() > some_time_value, false)
```

### yield_if(*bool*, *ret*)

Yield only if a condition is true (e.g. enough time has passed).

# HubInterface

## HubInterface()

The constructor for the HubInterface. The HubInterface is created automatically and this constructor doesn't usually need to be explicitly called.

## Run(()

```cpp
// SYNTAX
Run(unsigned long forHowLong)

// EXAMPLE USAGE
void loop()
{
  hub.Run(20);
}

```

Advance the device layer state machine, with forHowLong milliseconds as the max time available to spend performing library tasks (e.g., communicating with the rest of the device). It is expected that it will be called every cycle of a loop() function.

## IsReady()

```cpp
// EXAMPLE USAGE
bool ready_bool = hub.IsReady();
```

Whether or not the hub is ready to carry out other commands.

## SetLights()

```cpp
// SYNTAX
SetLights(unsigned char whichLights, unsigned char yellow, unsigned char blue, unsigned char slew)

// EXAMPLE USAGE
SetLights(hub.LIGHT_LEFT, 0, 80, 0); // Make the left touchpad lights blue with brightness 80

// Make the left and right light touchpads "white" ("equal" parts yellow and blue) with brightness 30
hub.SetLights(hub.LIGHT_LEFT | hub.LIGHT_RIGHT, 30, 30, 0);
```

Set light colors with slew (overloaded below for flashing).

*whichLights*: see LIGHT_... constants 

In this class colors and slew can be between [0, 99] each

Constant   | Value     | Description
-----------|-----------|------------
LIGHT_LEFT | 0b00000001| Left touchpad light
LIGHT_MIDDLE | 0b00000010| Middle touchpad light
LIGHT_RIGHT | 0b00000100| Right touchpad light

LIGHT_BTNS | 0b00000111| All the buttons/touchpads
LIGHT_ALL | 0b00001111| All the above


<aside class="notice">
While most humans have trichromatic vision (all the colors we can see can be described as a combination of red, green, and blue), most dogs and cats are dichromats only able to see the equivalent of human yellow and blue. This means that, in making games for dogs and cats, we usually only care about color settings expressed as "BY" rather than "RGB".
</aside>

## SetLightsRGB()

```cpp
// SYNTAX
SetLightsRGB(char whichLights, unsigned char red, unsigned char green, unsigned char blue, unsigned char slew)

// EXAMPLE
hub.SetLightsRGB(hub.LIGHT_CUE, 99, 0, 0, 0);
```

Set light colors with slew using RGB, not BY colors 

In this class colors and slew can be between [0, 99] each

hub.PresentFoodtreat(100);
```

Present foodtreat for specified duration, then close tray.

*duration_decisec*: specified amount of time (duration x 0.1 secs)

Setting duration_decisec to 0 will cause the foodtreat to be presented  indefinitely (in which case **RetractTray** will need to be called to retract).

// EXAMPLE USAGE
unsigned char pact_state = hub.PACT_BEFORE_PRESENT  hub.PACT_... are states of PresentAndCHeckFoodtreat state machine
// Run until one of two possible final states
while (!(pact_state == hub.PACT_RESPONSE_FOODTREAT_TAKEN || pact_state == hub.PACT_RESPONSE_FOODTREAT_NOT_TAKEN))  
{
    pact_state = hub.PresentAndCheckFoodtreat(1000);  state machine
    hub.Run(20);
}
```

Must be run in a loop as a state machine.

Present foodtreat for specified duration (*duration_ms* in millseconds) and returns a PACT_... state (table below) to indicate if food was eaten or not (defined in this class).

Advantages: some error checking, returns if food was eaten or not.
